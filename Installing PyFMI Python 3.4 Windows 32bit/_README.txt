Requirements:
Python 3.4 32bit installed on system

--------------------------------

Run the INSTALL.bat from its default folder. It will install all libraries that are required for PyFMI. Go through the installation processes that will be initiated. 

It will also upgrade pip (that usually comes with Python) to the latest version since it is needed to install the Python Library wheels (file ending "whl").

--------------------------------

This has been created on July 1st 2015. You might want to check for recent versions of the libraries. Make sure to download libs for Python 3.4 and for 32 bit!
